        <h1 class="title">The Differential Analyzer</h1>
        <p>The differential analyzer was an analog computer invented between
        1928 and 1931 by Vannevar Bush, then a professor of engineering at MIT.
        The machine was built to solve differential equations, which are often
        used in engineering and physics to model the behavior of dynamic
        systems. Some kinds of differential equation are trivial to solve, but
        most others are so complex that it is hard to even express their
        solutions in concrete mathematical terms.</p>
        <p>The differential analyzer solved these complex differential
        equations by numerically approximating them. The machine could do this
        even though it contained no electronic circuits, logic gates, or
        anything else that we might associate with a digital computer. It
        relied instead on the interplay of various mechanical moving parts to
        compute results.</p>
        <p>The most important part of the differential analyzer was the
        mechanical integrator. Below is a visualization of how the mechanical
        integrator worked. The visualization shows just one mechanical
        integrator, but the differential analyzer built by Bush actually had
        six—this allowed Bush to solve numerical equations of up to the sixth
        order. The final output produced by the differential analyzer
        was always a combination of the outputs of the integrators: each
        individual integrator's output was either fed into the next integrator
        as input, added to the output the next integrator, or subtracted from
        the output of the next integrator. Combining the outputs of the
        integrators was an engineering challenge that Bush was the first to
        overcome, but the integrators are where the magic happened; they did the
        real work of solving the equations.</p>
        <p>A mechanical integrator is basically a fancy summing machine. Its
        output is a graph of how many times a particular small wheel has
        revolved. The rate at which this wheel revolves is determined by a
        large spinning disk that drives the wheel. The disk can be displaced so
        that the wheel moves closer or further away from the center of the
        disk—the further away the wheel is from the center, the faster it
        spins. The operator of the machine would trace another graph as input
        to the machine and this input would control the displacement of the
        wheel.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to know more about the differential analyzer, I hope
        you take a look at my <a href="#">blog post</a> about it, which this
        visualization was created to accompany.</p>
